## How to run this project locally

1. Clone the repository
2. In project folder open terminal and run:
    - `yarn install` to install dependencies
    - `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode
    - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
3. Optionally, you can also run:
    - `yarn test` to run tests.
    - `yarn build` to build the app for production (to the`build` folder).
4. Even more optionally, you can:
    - `yarn eject` - as the app was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) this is a script that allows you to remove the single build dependency. All the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint etc.) will be copied right into the project giving full control over them.

## The development process

### 1. Keep in mind:

- Code quality
- Commits quality

### 2. Learn

1. [TDD & writing good tests](https://github.com/gregwell/university-notes/blob/main/english/javascript/currency-converter/currency-converter.md#tdd--writing-good-tests)
2. [Create-react-app config & JEST tests](https://github.com/gregwell/university-notes/blob/main/english/javascript/currency-converter/currency-converter.md#create-react-app-config--jest-tests)
3. [Interaction tests with Testing Library](https://github.com/gregwell/university-notes/blob/main/english/javascript/currency-converter/currency-converter.md#interaction-tests-with-testing-library)
4. [Different ways of fetching data from Web API](https://github.com/gregwell/university-notes/blob/main/english/javascript/currency-converter/currency-converter.md#different-ways-of-fetching-data-from-web-api)
5. [Dealing with CORS policy](https://github.com/gregwell/university-notes/blob/main/english/javascript/currency-converter/currency-converter.md#dealing-with-cors-policy)
6. [Testing asynchronous code](https://github.com/gregwell/university-notes/blob/main/english/javascript/currency-converter/currency-converter.md#testing-asynchronous-code)

### 3. Do

- [ ]  write the correct algorithm fetching data (asynchronous logic) from NBP API
- [ ]  cover edge cases
- [ ]  unit tests
- [ ]  user interface
- [ ]  web server
